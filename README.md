# Wine Quality Classification

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify wine quality into three categories: Low, Medium, and High based on physicochemical properties using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset contains various features such as alcohol content, acidity, sulfates, etc. The original dataset is available [here](link_to_dataset).

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing (handling duplicates, encoding labels)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Balancing classes with SMOTE
- Modeling with XGBoost
- Performance evaluation using classification report and confusion matrix

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Run the notebook/script

## Results
- Accuracy: 82%  
- Best performance on Medium quality wines
